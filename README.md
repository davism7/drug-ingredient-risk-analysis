# Drug Ingredient Risk Analysis

### Project Overview

Pharmaceutical companies face a higher likelihood of lawsuits, costly recalls, and reputation damage when their products contain high-risk ingredients. This project uses openFDA data to analyze historical ingredient trends and develop models that assess how likely a drug is to be involved in a serious adverse event. 

### Data Sources

Drug Product Labeling API
- The openFDA Drug Product Labeling API returns data that has been collected from the Structured Product Labeling (SPL), a database that contains product labeling information submitted by manufactures and distributors to the FDA.
  
Drug Adverse Event API
- The openFDA Drug Adverse Event API returns data that has been collected from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), a database that contains information on adverse event and medication error reports submitted to the FDA.
